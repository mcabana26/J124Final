### By Melissa Cabana
## Data Analysis Process
* Download the ["Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJPAhUcL1bI6ilt2nX3dlz3LWssY-z3rVvXJrZ6b9TU/edit?usp=sharing) as .csv files, upload to Google Drive, and open with Google Sheets
* Freeze and bold row one
* Insert descriptions of variables as notes for each cell in row one

*The following are five questions and step-by-step answers based on the dataset above:*

**Question 1: Which age group has the highest rate of diabetes?**

## Story Summary and Sourcing

I would interview Dr. Marie Agleham, a physician of Kaiser Permanente Northern California.  Dr. Agleham is involved with the Filipino American Care Experience (FACE), an organization that consists of Filipino-American physicians.  FACE has organized a program that provides Bay Area Filipino Kaiser patients with diabetes classes as part of diabetes education treatment.  The classes are part of a concept called culturally-responsive diabetes education programs, which provide treatment to diabetes patients catered towards their culture and identity as a means to help close the critical care gap.  By interviewing Dr. Agleham, I hope to gain more information and insight on what issues found within data on diabetes patients that prompted her and her colleagues to start this program, and how that program may provide a solution to diabetes disproportionately affecting certain groups of people.

In addition, I would also interview Blake Silva, a 21-year-old diabetes patient from Lodi, California in the Central Valley.  I hope to gain insight on what it has been like to live with diabetes and how he believes his social factors have contributed to his illness and treatment.
